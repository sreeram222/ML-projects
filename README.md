Machine Learning Classifiers Repository
Overview
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning classifiers, including:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes (GaussianNB)
- Decision Tree Classifier

Each classifier is implemented using Python and the scikit-learn library, with example datasets and performance evaluations.
Dataset
The repository includes sample datasets for testing the classifiers. You can also use your own datasets by modifying the data loading sections in the scripts.
Evaluation
Each classifier includes performance evaluation metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision & Recall
- Confusion Matrix

Contributions
Feel free to fork this repository, submit pull requests, or report issues.
